# L'infuseur

This project is carried out in our school setting, [Hetic](https://www.hetic.net/). The resquest was to make a site dedicated to a product. We chose L’Infuseur, it’s an infusion brand. It’s seemed like a good subject, cause our product is uncluttered and we could play a with different animations. We tried to show this product in particular, to promote the beauty of the product by using only front development. We work on a UI design according to the existing visual identity of the brand.
